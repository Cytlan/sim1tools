Sim1tools
=========

This is a collections of tools I made to parse and hack away on game files found in The Sims 1.

They're quite crap, this is just something I pull up every now and then for fun, but I thought I'd make it available.

It should be compatible with `node v14`, but your milage might vary.

You need to have a fairly decent understanding of JS, binary files and nodejs to get much use out of this.
